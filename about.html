                                   It was on a Saturday night at about 11.30 P.M. that happiness & joy filled the hearts of both my parents.
                                   I was born on November 28, 1998. I can not finish this chapter without mentioning my parents & my friend, I am lucky enough to have ever met them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My Educational's background is very similar to a roller coaster, I have completed my graduation in Bachelors of Enginnering in the year of 2020 (Corona Batch).
                                    After completing my graduation I was srtuggling for getting a well settled Job, I was appllied on most of the Private & Government Job profiles.
                                    I was appoint as Gradute Trainnee Enginner at "Aiport Authority Of India", Kolhapur. But at this time had Cornona Virus so, my parents are not allow me to join.
                                    After some time I was join another Semi Government sector named as "Mazgon Dockyard Shipbuilding, Ltd, Mumbai". 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I were work there for more than 6 months, after that I was desided back to the my native place.
                                    I was getting depressed for 2+ months due to srtuggling of personal problems, & some other. 
                                    After I working hard on my skills I join a Software Company & I work here since last 1.3 years as a Jr. Software Developer.
                                </p>
                                    <p>It all began during one of the busiest and most chaotic phases of my life. Deadlines loomed, responsibilities piled up, and I was barely holding it all together. And then she walked into my life, almost as if the universe had sent her to remind me that even amidst the storm, there’s a place for calm and beauty. At first, it was her radiant smile that caught my attention, but as I got to know her, it became so much more. There was something in her kindness, her care, and her effortless way of making everyone around her feel special that captivated me. She wasn’t just beautiful; she was everything.</p>

<p>What started as a simple friendship soon grew into something deeper, something more meaningful. Slowly, we became inseparable. She became my go-to person, my partner in crime, and the highlight of my days. After long, exhausting hours at work, we would meet for breakfast. We’d talk for hours, sharing stories, laughing over the smallest things, and making even the most ordinary moments feel extraordinary.</p>

<p>Weekends became our little escapes from the routine. Whether it was a walk through a quiet park or sitting together in comfortable silence, every moment with her felt like it had a purpose—a spark that brought my chaotic life into balance. She wasn’t just a friend anymore; she was my solace, my strength, and the person I looked forward to seeing, no matter how hard the day had been.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, something in me shifted. I began to care for her in ways I didn’t even think I was capable of. It wasn’t just about the moments we spent together but the way I started thinking of her happiness before my own. I wanted to protect her, to see her smile, and to be the reason behind that smile. I didn’t even realize when her presence became the most important part of my life.</p>

<p>It wasn’t all perfect, though. Like any close bond, we had our share of disagreements. Sometimes, it was about something as trivial as who forgot to reply first. Other times, it was about things I couldn’t even remember afterward. But those little arguments, rather than creating distance, only brought us closer. Every fight ended with heartfelt apologies, an even deeper connection, and a better understanding of each other.</p>

<p>She became my anchor, the one person who understood me better than anyone else. And I wanted to be her rock, too, the person she could always rely on. As much as I cherished our friendship, my heart wanted more. I began to wonder if she felt the same. But I was terrified—terrified of ruining everything if I told her the truth. What if confessing my love meant losing her forever? The thought of life without her in it was unbearable, so I kept my feelings hidden, choosing the safety of our friendship over the uncertainty of what could be.</p>

<p>Then one day, everything changed. She mentioned casually, almost in passing, that her family had started looking for a match for her. That moment hit me like a thunderbolt. My heart sank, and I felt a wave of disappointment and helplessness I couldn’t express to anyone. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, tears streaming down my face as I questioned why life had to be so unfair.</p>

<p><i>Why is this happening to me?</i> I asked myself over and over. <i>I’ve done nothing but love her, respect her, and care for her. Why can’t she see how much she means to me? Why can’t she feel what I feel?</i></p>

<p>By 1:30 AM, the weight of my emotions was too much to bear. With trembling hands, I picked up my phone and poured my heart out in a message. Every word was a piece of my soul, every sentence a reflection of the love I had been carrying for so long. My heart raced as I sent it, unsure of what her reaction would be.</p>

<p>When she read it, her response was not what I had hoped for. She was shocked, even angry. She told me she had only ever seen us as friends, nothing more. Her words shattered me. I tried explaining my feelings, but the more I spoke, the more distant she seemed. That night, we argued—not out of hate, but out of pain. Both of us cried. Every tear she shed felt like a dagger to my heart. The last thing I ever wanted was to hurt her. I loved her too much for that.</p>

<p>The next morning, I couldn’t bring myself to face her. The guilt of upsetting her weighed heavily on me, but my love for her was stronger than my pride. I reached out, apologizing for the pain I had caused. She forgave me, but only as a friend. I was back in the friend zone—a place that now felt like both a sanctuary and a prison.</p>

<p>Even so, something inside me refuses to give up. She may not see me as more than a friend right now, but my feelings for her are real and unwavering. I’ve decided that I’ll continue to show her how much she means to me, not through words but through actions. I’ll respect her choices and never force my love upon her, but I won’t suppress my feelings either.</p>

<p>She’s not just someone I met during a busy phase of my life. She’s become a part of my soul, a piece of my heart that I cannot unlove. For now, I’ll cherish every moment we share, every smile she gives me, and every memory we create. And who knows? Maybe one day, she’ll see the depth of my love for her and realize that I’ve been here all along, waiting patiently, loving her silently, and hoping against all odds that we’re meant to be.</p>
